# ----- Udev rules for Roboclaw motor controller
#
# This file contains Udev rules for identifying and creating a symlink for 
# the Roboclaw motor controller when it is connected to the system via a serial port.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to the '/etc/udev/rules.d/' directory.
#    You can use the following command:
#
#       `sudo cp 99-roboclaw.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/`
#
# 2. Reload the Udev rules for the changes to take effect.
#    `udevadm control --reload-rules` - reloads the Udev rules from the 
#      rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/). This ensures that any changes 
#       made to the rules files are taken into account.
#     `udevadm trigger` - triggers the Udev subsystem to reevaluate the rules 
#       and apply any changes. It ensures that the Udev rules are reapplied immediately, 
#       even if there are no specific device events.
#
#    `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger`
#
# To list all properties for ttyACM0:
#   `udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0`
#
# The following rule will create a symlink named 'roboclaw' when 
# the Roboclaw motor controller is connected:

# MODE = "0666" directive ensures that the device file (not the symbolic link) is readable 
# and writable by the file's owner, group, and others on the system.
