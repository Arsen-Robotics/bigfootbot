#version: '3.5' # version flag is Depricated in Docker compose V2?

# --- Docker compose commands ---

# Create and start containers defined in the compose file
# NOTE Docker Compose detects changes in your configuration files, 
# including the Dockerfile, and automatically rebuilds the corresponding images if necessary
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_description.yml up'
#
# Stop and remove containers that were created based on the 
# configuration specified in the compose file.
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_description.yml down'
# 
# Rebuild all services (all the images are built from scratch)
# --build option indicates that Docker Compose should rebuild the images, 
# even if they already exist
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_description.yml --build`
# 
# To rebuild the service 'bfb_description':
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_description.yml up --build bfb_description`
#
# To run the service 'bfb_description':
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_description.yml up bfb_description`
