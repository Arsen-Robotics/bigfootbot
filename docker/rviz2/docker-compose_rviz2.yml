# --- Docker compose commands ---
#
# Create and start containers defined in the compose file
# NOTE Docker Compose detects changes in your configuration files, 
# including the Dockerfile, and automatically rebuilds the corresponding images if necessary
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_rviz2.yml up'
#
# Stop and remove containers that were created based on the 
# configuration specified in the compose file.
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_rviz2.yml down'
# 
# Rebuild all services (all the images are built from scratch)
# --build option indicates that Docker Compose should rebuild the images, 
# even if they already exist
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_rviz2.yml up --build`
#
# To rebuild a certain service:
#   `docker compose up --build <service_name>`
#
# To run a certain service:
#   `docker compose up <service_name>`
#   `docker compose -f docker-compose_rviz2.yml up humble_rviz2`
