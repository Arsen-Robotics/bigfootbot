# Design Documentation

## Architecture Overview
The BFB Arduino Gateway package implements a bridge between ROS 2 and Arduino hardware using a simple but robust architecture:

```
[ROS 2 Network] <---> [ArduinoGatewayNode] <---> [Arduino Mega]
```

## Components

### ArduinoGatewayNode
The main node that handles:
- Serial communication with Arduino
- Connection management
- Command forwarding
- Error handling

### Communication Protocol
- Serial communication at 9600 baud
- Commands are sent as strings followed by newline
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## Design Decisions

### Connection Management
- Implemented automatic reconnection to handle Arduino disconnections
- Uses a timer-based approach to periodically check connection status
- Maintains connection state to avoid redundant logging

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling for serial communication
- Graceful degradation on connection loss
- Detailed error logging for debugging

### Command Protocol
- Simple string-based protocol for maximum compatibility
- Newline-terminated commands for reliable parsing
- Queue-based message handling to prevent command loss

## Future Improvements
1. Add command validation
2. Implement command queuing
3. Add status feedback from Arduino
4. Support multiple Arduino devices
5. Add configuration file support
